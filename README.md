## Installation
To run this app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your system. If not, you can install it from the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. To build: You'll need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/) and [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). You will need to sign in to your Apple Developer account to run the app on your device.

From your command line:

```bash
# Go into the folder
$ cd max_heart_reader

# Install dependencies
$ flutter clean
$ flutter pub get

# Run the app
$ flutter run
```

> **Note**
> If you're testing on iOS, [see this guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/build-modes). The default mode is `--debug` where the app cannot run in standalone mode.

### Build for iOS: Create Podfile

To begin, create a `Podfile` in the root directory of your iOS project. The `Podfile` specifies the dependencies for your project. Open the terminal and navigate to your project's root directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/YourProjectIOSFolder

# If Podfile does not exist
touch Podfile

pod install

# Open .xcworkspace
open Runner.xcworkspace

# Click on the play button in Xcode to build and run the app.
```
